        %p Note that we are only looking for very high quality videos on this site. This means:
        %ul
          %li the videos must have high production values, ideally with multiple cameras, and be mixed professionally
          %li videos *must* be HD (720p or higher resolution)
          %li sound quality must be good, without distracting background noise
          %li presenters should not be using notes
          %li slides should contain minimal text, and no bullet points
        %p Only clever, funny, thought-provoking or just generally interesting videos should be uploaded to IgniteTalks.io! Anything else can still go on the individual Ignite's YouTube channel.
        %p Please actually watch the video all the way through before you upload it.
