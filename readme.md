#IgniteTalks.io

###Purpose of this site

  * to promote the Ignite brand
  * to showcase examples of the best videos
  * to allow people to find their nearest Ignite, including showing upcoming events
  * to help people to set up an Ignite if they want to start one

####Out of scope for the site:
  * to be a repository for every Ignite video
  * to promote any particular city’s Ignite
  * to host the videos (they should be on YouTube)

The site needs to be low-maintenance and largely self-supporting, without onerous demands once it’s set up. To that that end, there is no user registration (aside from administrators), no voting, no comments, no speaker bios, etc.

###Videos

Only the best videos should be listed on the Global Ignite site. They will be chosen by the moderators, including from submissions by each city. 

The videos on the site should be uploaded and hosted by each individual city on their own YouTube, and linked on the Global Ignite page. This way, maintenance/moderation of the videos is the responsibility of the original city. This approach will also preserve any page views/comments already existing on each video.

####Videos must be in HD format

Only videos at 720p or 1080p resolution should be loaded. This is becuase the video thumbnails assume HD resolution (and we should only be promoting high quallity videos anyway.)
